# UniESA
A unified farmework for effectively and accurately engineering enzyme stereoselectivity and  activity.  

## Introduction of UniESA
High stereoselectivity, as well as activity, is essential for enzymeâ€™s application in green industrial context. UniESA provides a unified framework for effectively and accurately engineering enzyme stereoselectivity and activity, and therefore can potentially significantly expedite the search for high-fitness enzyme mutants with minimal laboratory work. UniESA offers a rational, data-driven framework for large-scale enzyme characteristic optimization, and is suitable for green enzyme engineering in industrial context.

## Usage
`encoding.py`  is used to represent the amino acid sequence of an enzyme as input to the model.  
`compare.py`  is used to compare the effectiveness of different representation methods. 
`train.py`  is used to train enzyme fitness prediction model.
